This project solves a more complicated version of the Sudoku puzzle using forward checking, backtracking, besides MRV and degree heuristics. 
In this version of the puzzle, each sub-grid has its own color, and in the final state of the puzzle, in addition to the specific arrangement of the numbers, the adjacent sub-grids must have different colors.
